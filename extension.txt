My extension program takes in 3 arguments.

The first argument is the database file to be loaded into the graph. Typically
movie_casts.tsv.

The second argument is a header followed by a list of actors (separated by
newline characters) that the user wishes to find the average distance of from
every other other actor in the database.

The third argument is the output file to write to.

What the extension program does is takes in an actor and finds their relative
distance to every other actor in the database. Or at least, every other actor
that they can be linked to. It then averages out the distances and returns 
that value. 

The algorithm is similar to Dijkstra's but doesn't break when a certain
destination vertex is reached, but rather when every actor has been visited
or every reachable actor has been visited (pq is empty).

I tested this program out by created my own cast database and solving the
average numbers for different actors by hand. The program returned the same
numbers and therefore makes me believe the program is functional.

Contrary to what this assignment made me believe, there are a lot of actors
with a lower average distance to every other actor than Kevin Bacon.

Example of running my program

./extension movie_casts.tsv ext_test.txt output.txt
